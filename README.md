# what is this?
This is the data of Subway and Bus in 2021 and 2022 that I downloaded from the official website of MBTA of MA, and I chose the data from October 2021 to September 2022. Each month, the 20th to 26th is selected as the data for one week for analysis.

# What did I doï¼Ÿ
First, I read the subway and bus data from October 2021 to September 2022.
Secound, I selected the data from the 20th to the 26th of each month for integration.
Third, for subway, I chose route_id and sorted out The Count of each line (Blue, Green, Mattapan,Orange and Red). And then I drew it.
Fourth, I chose route_id and travel time to compare, how long is the average travel time of each line.
Fifth, I chose point_type for bus, and different point_type times are different.
Sixth, I choose the point_type and headway to draw the diagram, but some progress is NA. I use the method of removing NA and use the point_type as the X-axis and the average headway as the Y-axis in the final drawing.
I select the point_type and the average scheduled_headway to draw the graph.
Eighth, I calculate the difference between the headway and the scheduled_headway.
